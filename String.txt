SCP:
It is a special memory location in the heap area which stores String literals.

The String objects are immutable, which means once a string object is created
its data or state cant be changed.

Multiple String Objects can be concatenated using + operator.

The parameters used for network connections, database connection URLs, username/passwords
are represented in string.

String class is thread safe, thereby it solves synchronization issues.
